most important assets of any organization is its information.
in two forms: the operational systems of record and the data warehouse. 
This asset is almost always used for two purposes: operational record keeping and analytical decision making.
the operational systems are where the data is put in, and the data warehouse is where we get the data out.

The data warehouse must make an organization’s information easily accessible.
The data warehouse must present the organization’s information consistently.
The data warehouse must be adaptive and resilient to change. 
The data warehouse must be a secure bastion that protects our information assets. 
The data warehouse must serve as the foundation for improved decision making.
The business community must accept the data warehouse if it is to be deemed successful. 

4 main components of DWH:
operational source systems
Data Staging Area
Data Presentation Area
Data access tools

Extracting is the first step process in getting data into datawarehouse.
Tranforming
Loading data into datawarehouse

The key difference between 3NF and dimension models is the degree of normalization.
Data in the queryable presentation area of the data warehouse must be dimensional, must be atomic, and must adhere to the data warehouse bus architecture.

Metadata - data about data.
Operation Data Store - ODSs are frequently updated, somewhat integrated copies of operational data.
Fact Table - Numerical Performance measurements of buisness are stored.
A row in a fact table corresponds to a measurement. A measurement is a row in a
fact table. All the measurements in a fact table must be at the same grain. 

The most useful facts in a fact table are numeric and additive. 
The fact table itself generally has its own primary key made up of a subset of the foreign keys. This key is often called a composite or concatenated key.

A data warehouse almost always demands data expressed at the lowest possible
grain of each dimension not because queries want to see individual low-level rows,
but because queries need to cut through the details in very precise ways.

Data warehouses always need an explicit date dimension table. There are many
date attributes not supported by the SQL date function, including fiscal periods,
seasons, holidays, and weekends. Rather than attempting to determine these nonstandard calendar calculations in a query, we should look them up in a date dimension table.

Additive Fact
Semi Additive Fact
Nonadditive Fact --- example Unit Price

Dimension tables are integral companions to a fact table. The dimension tables contain the textual context associated with a business process measurement event. They
describe the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” associated with the event.
