Lamba is used for run code snippets - short peiece of code
Serverless
Stateless


Lamba Advantanges:
Scalability
Integrations
Pay for what you use

Cost components:
Number of requests
Allocated memory
-128MB to 3008 MB
Increments of 64 MB
Duration
100 ms increments a, rounded up 
900 seconds limit.

Number of requests
-$0.20 per million (US East)

Memory and duration
-$0.0000166667 per GB seconds

Lambda integrations:
1. S3  ( trigger with storage releated events
IOT - trigger with custom rule
SNS - trigger by subscribing to a topic
Kinesis data stream - reads from stream and invokes
DynamoDB stream - reads from stream and invokes


Labda Use Cases:
File processing:
-onvoke on s3 events

stream processing:
Kinesis data tsreams

kinesis firehouse:
dynamoDB stream

Scheduler -
Invoke on cloudwatch events

Kinesis data streams:
retires until success or expiration
blocks kinesis shards
Payload limit is 6 MB

Performance:
Adjust memory
15 minutes limit

Lambda Antipatterns:
Stateful application
Long running code


AWS Glue:
ETL focused
Serverless
Fully managed Spark cluster


ETL Issues: More data
Changinf formats and schemas
Complicated operations - Managing infrastructure, Handling errors

GLUE Components
Data catalog - DB's and crawlers
ETL - Job authoring and execution

Glue Antipattersn:
Many small jobs runinng
Need to customize spark cluster

Glue Pricing:
Monthly free tier
$1 per million requests


AWS _ EMR: Elastic Map reduce

Transient Vs Lon-running EMR cluster
Optimizing Instance types
Configuring ENR
Batch Processing with EMR
Stream processing with EMR


Need for EMR:
Hadoop setup and operations
Overprovisioning
Integration with AWS

EMR: Managed Hadoop and Spark service
AWS integrations
Decoupling storage and compure as which is very important for achieving scalability and lowering costs.

EMR Storage: HDFS - default size - 128MB
Local file systame - EC2 instances
EMR file syate - Kind of hadoop distributed file systems S3 to S3 

EMR nodes:
Master Node ( one or 3 master nodes for high availaility)
Core nodes - on HDFS
Task nodes - number of data processing 


Transient vs Long- Running Clusters:

Transient                            Lond running
Terrminates automatically            Terminates manually
Run 1-hour job 10 times a day        Run 2 -hour job 12 times a day
Needs Initialization ( 15 mins)      Available
Data exploration, experiments        Machine Learning interations on HDFS


Instance Types:
Batch processing - general purpose instances
Machine Learning - compute instances
Deep learning - GPU instances
Large HDFS - storage instances
Large interactive analysis - Memory instances
