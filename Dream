Indha Chinnathai Chidambaram yarunu theriyama irundhuten,, na Yaaru nu theriyum neram varum, Kadavul eni yen pakkam, 
Yen Valkaila na eni yepdi jeikanumo adhu nadakum kandipa, apdi jeikiren,

I Can and I Will - My Mantra.


you are the only one who can assign meaning to your life.
if “I” change, the world will change. 
You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.”
I really want to do this, and I'll do it when the time comes. This is a way of living that postpones life.
One must not get too serious. Be earnest but not too serious.
If one is living each moment earnestly, there is no need to get too serious.
Shine a Light on the Here and Now
It is true that one cannot change the past. If there is something that can be changed, it is the future.
if one is shining a bright spotlight on here and now, one cannot see the past or the future anymore.

My husband is my life, My life is my Husband.
I am getting married soon, God always wants us to live our best.
