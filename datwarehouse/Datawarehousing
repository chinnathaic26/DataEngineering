1. What is a Data Warehouse?
Answer:
A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository used to store large volumes of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. It is designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing.

Example:
An e-commerce platform stores data about customers, orders, and products from transactional databases in a data warehouse to analyze sales trends.


2. How is a Data Warehouse different from a Database?
Answer:

Data Warehouse: Optimized for analytical processing (OLAP), storing historical data, and supporting decision-making.
Database: Optimized for transactional processing (OLTP), supporting day-to-day operations.
Example:

Database: Recording a product sale in an online store.
Data Warehouse: Analyzing the product sales over the past year to forecast demand.
