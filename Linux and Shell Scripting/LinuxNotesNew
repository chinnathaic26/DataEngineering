==================================================
Find files

find . -name '*.jpg'  ===> case sensitive search

find . -iname '*.jpg' ===> case insensitive search

find . -name '*.jpg' -mindepth N  ===> directory N levels down

-user <username>
-group <groupname>
-readable
-writable
-executable
-perm NNNN
-empty
-size N

find . -name '*report*' -perm 06444 -atime 10 -size +10M

searching by time :

-amin N , cmin N , mmin N ( accessed, changed, modified N minutes ago)

-atime N , ctime N , -mtime N ( accessed, changed, modified N*24 hours ago )
======================================================

Locate command

locate jpg  (case sensitive)

locate -i jpg  ( case insensitive) 

locate -i zip jpg  ( multiple params)

locate -A .jpg.zip

locate -c .jpg ( count number of files )

shows executable : 

which bash
