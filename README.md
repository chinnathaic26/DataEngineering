As part of my learning I used to learn mostly from free resources with good content.
for Linux I prefered **https://www.lpi.org/** to gain more knowledge on Linux part which is utilized in my current data engineering project.
Linux essentials, LPIC-1, LPIC-2 learning materials are good enough to kick start.
