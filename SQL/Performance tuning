1. use select column_name from statement, instead select *
2. use group by instead of distinct
3. top/limit
4.use primary key in create table statement
5.use index in sql.
6. use UNION instead of OR condition.
7.Avoid too many JOINS.
8. Create JOINS with inner Join not WHERE.

Question 1:
The number of rows will be very high in a Master Table or Parent Table. This statement is true or false.  FALSE
Question 2:
The SQL performance tuning consideration has to be given to --- type of table. CHILD TABLE not MASTER TABLE


CHAR and VARCHAR:
CHAR - becoz of fixed length definition, more disk space is utilized and results in negative effects on query execution.
When to use CHAR?? when lenghth is fixed
When to use VARCHAR?? when length is not sure.

column position number or column name should be mentioned in order by clause for fast processing.

Sequence flow of execution:

FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT COLUMN LIST
ORDER BY

Performance impact of where vs having clause:
use where clause wherever possible

select colr,sum(qty) from colors where colr <> black group by colr having sum(qty)>10000

select colr,sum(qty) from colors group by colr having sum(qty)>1000 and colr<>black

count(*) will be slow
instead use count(1) will be better.

use correlated sub query using Exists ( super fast )
select ename, sal, deptno from emp where EXISTS (select null from dept where emp.deptno=dept.deptno);
